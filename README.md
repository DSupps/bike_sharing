# bike_sharing

## Challenge Overview:
*After a trip to remember last summer to New York City with a friend of mine, we have decided that we would like to open a bike sharing business in our hometown of Des Moines, Iowa.  After pitching the idea to potential investors, one of them really liked the idea and would like to be involved.  However, they would like more details about the business and what to expect if one were to be opened in Des Moines.*

*To convince potential investors that a bike sharing business in Des Moines is a good idea, Kate and I have decided  to look at some data about the one in New York City and create a proposal.*

   - There are a total of 13,383 bikes used in August and it appears that there about 20 of them that are used way more than the other.
   - Those bikes that are larger and red in color will possibly be in need of maintenance due to distance traveled. 
   - There are a lot of bikes that don't travel as far as the others.
